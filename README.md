A Simple Messenger App
This app serves as a simply constructed messenger app to be used for communication by people across great distances by taking messages written by the users and posting them to a message board which can be viewed by anyone who knows the web address. 
I made this mostly because I wanted to have a more private message board due to a general dislike and distrust of the currently popular social networking websites on the internet right now. I figured that at the very least it would be interesting to have a place where people that I know and trust can communicate where every factor is controlled by me.
It was also made to be a showcase of my abilities and the things I learned from phase 2 of the flatiron school software engineering program.
