# Simple Messenger App

This Simple Messaging App works as a basic chatroom for people.
It is a very simple **_React_** App, which works by grabbing data created on 2 different pages.

# Setup
Using this app requires you to have a computer to have NPM and Node installed. Meaning as as a baseline you will need to run this command in your CLI (Terminal for MacOS, Command Shell or PowerShell for Windows), if you haven't already:
```
 npm Install -g npm
```
 If you are unsure if you have already have NPM and Node, you can run these commands to check if they are installed:
 ```
 node -v
 npm -v
 ```
